  <embed id="video" src="media/Ann.pdf"> My name is Kris Ann. I’m 18 years old, and I see myself in three simple yet meaningful things such as a candle, a river, and a tree, because each of them reflects 
how I live, grow, and endure through different stages of my life. Like a candle, I try to be a source of light for others even when I feel small or unnoticed. I do
not always speak the loudest or stand at the center of attention, but I show my care through quiet actions, listening, helping, and simply being present when someone
needs comfort. There are moments when I feel exhausted, when my energy is low and my own worries threaten to dim my flame, yet I continue to shine because I believe 
that even the smallest light can make a difference in someone’s darkness. Just like a candle slowly burns itself to give warmth, I sometimes give more of myself than
I realize, learning along the way how to balance caring for others and protecting my own well-being.
    
    I also see myself as a river, constantly moving and changing as life pushes me forward. I am shaped by my experiences, both the gentle and the painful ones, and 
each of them leaves a mark on who I am becoming. There are times when my life feels calm, steady, and predictable, flowing smoothly as I follow a path I understand. 
But there are also moments when everything feels overwhelming, like rushing water crashing against rocks, forcing me to confront fear, uncertainty, and self-doubt. 
Even in those moments, I continue to move forward, because stopping is never truly an option. Like a river that finds a way around obstacles instead of giving up, 
I learn to adapt, to bend without breaking, and to trust that every challenge is shaping me into someone stronger, wiser, and more resilient. 
    
    Lastly, I see myself in a tree that is rooted, growing, and standing firm through storms. My roots represent my values, my past experiences, and the people who 
have supported me through difficult times. They keep me grounded when life feels unstable and remind me of where I come from and what truly matters to me. As I grow, 
I stretch my branches toward my dreams and goals, even when the journey feels slow or uncertain. I understand that growth does not happen overnight, just as a tree 
does not become strong in a single season. Each hardship I face adds another ring to my trunk, another silent proof that I have survived and continued to grow. Even
when storms hit, bringing failure, disappointment, or loss, I remain standing, learning to endure rather than collapse. 

    Together, the candle, the river, and the tree represent the balance within me. My ability to give light, to change and adapt, and to remain strong and grounded. 
They remind me that I am still a work in progress, continuously shaped by life yet capable of shining, flowing forward, and standing tall no matter what comes my way.
