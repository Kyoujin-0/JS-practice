        <p>Your efforts will never betray you, but they can always come betray your dreams. Not all dreams will come true through effort, actually, most of them won’t even come true. But if you tried your best, you can take solace in that.</p>

    <h2 id="subTitle">Who I Am</h2>
    <div class="section-card">
        <p>My name is Godyvir H. Binalay. There isn’t much to say about me, but I suppose this introduction requires that I say something. People expect a neat little summary of who you are, your interests, your goals, your strengths. I was genuinely just trying to make this longer since I don't have anything to say, but maybe it’s easier to give them what they want than to explain why you don’t have an answer.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="subTitle">What Resonates With Me</h2>
    <div class="section-card">
        <ul>
            <li>Life is mostly about trying things out and figuring out what works. Games, coding, and music are part of that process for me. Games are not just a way to pass the time; they’re a mix of challenge and distraction. They were a drug of silence and a peace that hooks me; it makes me drown but it doesn’t hurt my lungs. I was fascinated by games, so I chose to take this course, and maybe you could even see me one day creating a game too, as my project or as an activity for a school requirement.</li>
            <li>Coding is different. Coding is where things actually get built. It can be frustrating, and sometimes nothing works the way it should. I don’t necessarily enjoy coding, but I’ve realized it was something that just needs to be done and something that I must excel at since I already put myself into this situation. Anyways, seeing a program do what it’s supposed to do is satisfying. It’s a quiet kind of reward that doesn’t need applause.</li>
            <li>Music, on the other hand, serves a slightly different purpose. Sometimes it’s just background, but often it’s a way to shut down overthinking. Listening to something loud, simple, or even absurdly catchy can completely numb the brain for a while, which is convenient when my thoughts start spiraling. In other words, it’s a built-in dumb mode switch. It makes me feel relaxed at times or motivated when I need to push through.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
        <p>This page isn’t a resume or a list of accomplishments. It’s a snapshot of what takes up a few hours of my day and keeps things moving. Games, coding, and music aren’t everything about me, but they’re part of the structure that organizes how I spend my time. If someone has been capable of reading all this nonsense and managed to pay attention to such useless messages, I’ll give you a reward: here’s a piece of knowledge, saying that if you change, the world changes with you is a lie. It’s just a convenient lie forced on you, just to make you compromise. There’s no grand narrative here, no big story. Just a few pieces that make up a regular part of life, and a few images to show them.</p>
